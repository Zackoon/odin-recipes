        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Simple and easy to make, Kueh Lapis is a steamed cake dish originating from Indonesia. This recipe specifically uses pandan for all layers of flavoring in addition to the coconut base, and for the colors, the choice is yours!</p>

            <p>When making Kueh Lapis, patience is key; let each layer set (will give tips on how to determine that below) before you add the next. The process is relatively low maintenance as well: just ladle the layers one at a time, and leave it to steam before progressing to the next.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>300 mL Coconut Milk</li>
                <li>180 grams Fine Sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp Pandan Essence</li> 
                <li>260 mL Boiling Water</li>
                <li>200 grams Tapioca Flour</li>
                <li>20 grams Rice Flour</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start heating your water to a slow boil.</li>
                <li>Once the water is boiling, add it to your sugar to melt it, in addition to the salt and pandan essence.</li>
                <li>Add in your coconut milk to cool the mixture. You'll want to cool this down from boiling because if it's too hot, it'll cook some of the flour, leading to a clumpy mixture. </li>
                <li>Add in both of your flours, and mix well.</li>
                <li>Optionally, if you would like different colors, you can separate mixtures into separate bowls to add food coloring to.</li>
                <li>Set up your steamer, and once it is ready, pour your first layer (cover the bottom and a little more). This initial layer will be a little thicker to assist with easier removal of the cake at the end.</li>
                <li>After 10 minutes of steaming, check if the layer is ready. You can determine this by touching the back of a spoon to the surface: if it sticks, wait a little longer, but if it doesn't you can add your next layer.It is up to your preference how thick you enjoy your layers, but I recommend trying it on the thinner sideâ€”just enough to cover the surface each time (this lets you can peel it layer by layer when you eat it).</li>
                <li>Keep adding layers until your batter is used up our your container is full. Make sure to refill your steamer's water once in a while so that it doesn't cook dry!</li>
            </ol>

        <p>Enjoy your pandan layer cake!</p>
